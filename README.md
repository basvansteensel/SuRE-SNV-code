# SuRE-SNV-pipeline

These git submodules contain scripts and code associated with the manuscript
"J. van Arensbergen et al: Systematic identification of human SNPs affecting
regulatory element activity."

The 3 submodules are:
1. **SuRE-variants-pipeline:** a pipeline for processing the raw sequencing data; fastq files for iPCR and cDNA samples are processed to generate:
  * SuRE-counts tables (tabular data with SuRE-fragments and associated (SNP) annotation
  * Bigwig tracks with genome-wide SuRE-signal profiles
2. **SuRE-raQTL-scripts:** a collection of scripts to generate the *raQTLs* from the SuRE-count tables
3. **SuRE-figure-scripts:** a collection of scripts used to generate some of the figures in the manuscript
